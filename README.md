# Focus Ramp

A web application that helps people gradually build their capacity for focused work using structured Pomodoro sessions.

## What It Does

Focus Ramp turns a long-term focus goal into a structured training plan. Instead of trying to work for hours on day one, the app creates a gradual ramp that builds your deep work capacity over time.

You define:

- How long you want to be able to focus each day (target daily minutes)
- When you want to reach that level (end date)
- Which days you want to train (e.g. Monday through Friday)

Focus Ramp automatically generates a day-by-day plan that:

- Starts with manageable sessions
- Increases incrementally over training days
- Respects your chosen training schedule
- Guides you through each day using Pomodoro-style work and break segments

## How It Works

Each training day includes:

- A specific daily target focus time
- Structured work sessions (maximum 25 minutes each)
- Short breaks between sessions (5 minutes)
- A timer that guides you segment by segment

As you progress through the plan:

- Daily targets gradually increase
- Your focus capacity builds naturally
- You track completion and maintain streaks
- The final day reaches your target daily focus time

## Design Philosophy

The app emphasizes gentle progression and clarity. The interface uses a calm, glassmorphic design inspired by Apple's aesthetic, creating a distraction-free environment that supports deep work rather than adding cognitive load.
